Experiments to compare data serialization/modeling libraries.

Currently only considering:
  * Thrift
  * Protobuf

The thrift scrooge generation script won't work unless you've built scrooge locally.  Manual generation of scrooge thrift definitions shouldn't be necessary, though -- we'd likely use the sbt plugin for that.
